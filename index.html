      <h2>Thank You Love</h2>
      <p>Having you in my life, and maintaining you have been a success for a very long time. I dont know how i managed to make you feel happy enough to make you stay, but, hell yeah I did.
      Yeah i know that its a 2 player game, but it felt like you were the one who carries all the burden in this relationship. </p>
      <p>I know youre fighting a fight alone even if its meant to be a team battle, you keep on choosing to fight alone to keep me focus on finishing my plans, that i always promise will come in no time, just like a hero keeping the foes busy just to give time to the other hero's to make a powerful move enough to extinguish the remaining enemies.</p>

    <div class="sorry">
      <hr>
      <img class="sorry-image" src="images/sorry.png" alt="">
      <h2>Sorry for being a Menace</h2>
      <p>Sorry, ofcourse, theres no way I wont be apologizing for everything ive done thats wrong, wether I knew it or not. I deeply apologize. There are so many things I am apologizing for, but ill prioritize the ones that i know caused you a lot of pain.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Not able to bond with you because of my work and plans</li>
        <li>first is, not knowing that youre craving attention from me, specially in times that you really needed it.</li>
        <li>Not noticing the little efforts youre making to make me notice you.</li>
        <li>I always require a logical meaning/explanation towards a certain action that you make.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="promise">
      <hr>
      <img class="promise-image" src="images/promise.png" alt="">
      <h2>Promises, Promises, Promises</h2>
      <p>This is the one that I will be changing to make this relationship works. I am not making any promises anymore. Ill just do it, and keep on doing it until i achieve what is required or needed.
      I wont promise that ill be less logical, but will always read between the lines of every words you say, I wont promise that ill abandon my work or projects but i will squeeze my work and project in my time and not you, because you should be the one occupying more of it,
      and, I wont promise that I will love you until the end of time, but I will always care for you, worry about you, think about you, feed you, until the last drop of your love for me runs out.</p>

    <h2>Clearing the clutter</h2>
    <p>Before you leave this website, or before I change the content of it, I would like to clear all the things that you falsely think about me.</p>
    <p>I will never ever leave you for another girl, and will never make even a small effort of doing something stupid that may cause you pain.</p>
    <p>It may look like it, but I am not doing any of this just for me, its always because of you, if it is for me, i will not do anything to improve my life, because a minimum wage is enough to feed me for the rest of my life.</p>
    <p>and finally, not loving you will always be the hardest thing that I will do, besides, not loving someone is kind of exhausting and needs a lot of effort, so, ill just love you instead, because I was born for it, and will die doing it.</p>
